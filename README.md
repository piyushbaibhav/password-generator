# Password Generator App

This is a simple React application that generates random passwords based on user preferences. Users can specify the password length, whether they want numbers included, or special characters included. The generated password can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.

For styling this project I've used Tailwind.

I did this project with the help of YouTube channel `chai aur code ` Here is the link to the channel: [Chai aur Code](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode)

I made this  project to practice react and increase my confidence.

I have practiced the concept of hooks through this project. 

This project wasn't much complex yet it strengthened my basics of react.
